Before the external evaluation, i.e., the survey visit, the healthcare \nfacility is expected to conduct a comp rehensive self -assessment to decide on the level of its \npreparedness and how far or how close it is from achieving full compliance with the standards. \nAccreditation therefore, represents a public recognition by the health care accreditation body of \nthe ach ievement of accreditation standards by a health care facility.

Examples include patient assessment, patient \neducation, medication administration, and alike. Outcome standards look at the assessment of the \nbenefits of an intervention and  whether the expected purpose of the activity was achieved.

Its first official inauguration was after the Ministerial Decree number 144187/11 in \nOctober 2005, which called for the formation of the Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare \nInstitutions, tasked with the initiation of a national voluntary healthcare accreditation program. \nIn 1434/2013, the Council of Ministers mandated accreditation by CBAHI and gave the board its \ncurrent name. \nThe mission of the Saudi Central Board is to support all healthcare facilities, through accreditation \nto continuously comply with quality and patient safety standards.\nThe vision of the Saudi Central Board is to be the leading healthcare accreditation agency in the \nregion.", "to continuously comply with quality and patient safety standards.\nThe vision of the Saudi Central Board is to be the leading healthcare accreditation agency in the \nregion.\nIn addition to the Ambulatory Healthcare Accreditation program, CBAHI currently has three other \naccreditation programs (Primary Healthcare, Hospital Healthcare and Clinical Laboratories and \nBlood Banks). Other accreditation programs are under process. \nCBAHI\u2019s goal is to achieve two conjoined initiatives, in congruence with (the 2030) vision. The \nfirst initiative is to expand the range of efficient and effective accreditation programs to cover \nhealthcare services. The second initiative is to work with several partners to support the health \nsystem in Saudi Arabia and the region by increasing the depth of quality improvement and patient \nsafety, as well as by disseminating knowledge through training and education. Driven by its core", "system in Saudi Arabia and the region by increasing the depth of quality improvement and patient \nsafety, as well as by disseminating knowledge through training and education. Driven by its core \nvalues, a dedicated team of surveyors and staff, CBAHI is determined to be a major driving force \nand a recognized standard for the provision of safe and high-quality healthcare.\nCBAHI is proud to be one of the few healthcare accreditation agencies globally, accredited by the \nInternational Society for Quality in Healthcare (ISQua), for hospital standards, surveyor training \nprograms and for organization.\nHealthcare Accreditation: Definition and Importance \nHealthcare accreditation is an assessment process that involves a rigorous, transparent and \ncomprehensive evaluation by an external independent accreditation body.

The Healthcare Facility \n(HCF) undergoes an appraisal of its systems, processes and performance by peer reviewers or \nsurveyors, to ensure that all tasks are conducted in a manner that meets applicable predetermined \nand published national standards. Before the external evaluation, i.e., the survey visit, the HCF is \nexpected to conduct a comprehensive self-assessment to determine its level of preparedness, and \nhow close it is to achieving full compliance with the standards. Therefore, accreditation represents \nthe healthcare accreditation body\u2019s public recognition of the achievement of accreditation \nstandards by an HCF. Standards set out a common framework to support HCFs in providing \neffective, timely and quality services.

They are designed to deliver improved levels of care and \ntreatment to the citizens and residents of Saudi Arabia. Evidence from scientific research shows \nthat engagement in a robust healthcare accreditation program improves the structure, process \nand outcome of care that healthcare facilities provide. Accreditation is not merely a certificate to \nobtain and hang on the wall. If utilized properly, accreditation can provide the following benefits:\n12\n\u2022 Accreditation provides a framework for organizational structure and management. \nAccreditation standards focus on the governance and leadership structures and \nfunctions within a HCF and the appropriate management of its business and day-to-\nday activities.\n\u2022 Accreditation helps improve patient safety and minimizes the risk of near misses, adverse \noutcomes and medical errors. Ensuring patient safety through risk management and", "day activities.\n\u2022 Accreditation helps improve patient safety and minimizes the risk of near misses, adverse \noutcomes and medical errors. Ensuring patient safety through risk management and \nrisk reduction is at the center of all accreditation standards and is the ultimate goal of \nthe self-assessment and survey activities.\n\u2022 Accreditation enhances community confidence in the quality and safety of care provided. \nWhen a HCF achieves accreditation, the message is clear \u2013 its leaders are committed to \nproviding a nationally accepted standard of care in health services delivery.\n\u2022 Surveyed HCFs have found that seeing their operation through the eyes of experienced \nsurveyors gave them a useful, more objective assessment of their internal administrative \nand clinical processes, as well as effective proposals for improving their processes and \nservices delivered  to the community.\n\u2022 Accreditation in the long term, increases efficiency and enhances lean practices, which", "services delivered  to the community.\n\u2022 Accreditation in the long term, increases efficiency and enhances lean practices, which \nin turn leads to decreasing waste and achieving optimal results with less consumption \nof resources.  \n\u2022 Accreditation helps improve a healthcare facility\u2019s competitiveness.\n\u2022 Boosting public confidence in an accredited facility will encourage more patients to \nseek care and treatments in that facility. This will positively impact its competitiveness in \nthe healthcare sector and increase its market share.\n\u2022 Achieving accreditation will fulfill the regulations required by the Ministry of Health, \nwhich is now considering linking the national accreditation by CBAHI to the licensing \nof healthcare facilities.\n\u2022 Registration with CBAHI and enrollment in its national accreditation program are \naccepted by the Ministry of Health (at this stage) as satisfactory evidence for the purpose", "\u2022 Registration with CBAHI and enrollment in its national accreditation program are \naccepted by the Ministry of Health (at this stage) as satisfactory evidence for the purpose \nof license renewal. Eventually all HCFs operating in Saudi Arabia must achieve CBAHI \naccreditation.\n\u2022 Accreditation has a link to reimbursement from insurers and other third parties. There \nis a growing tendency, nationally and internationally, to link accreditation with eligibility \nfor insurance reimbursement.\n\u2022 Accreditation provides a robust tool for continuous quality improvement efforts in the \nHCFs and helps facility leadership to ensure the sustainability of quality improvement \nprojects and initiatives.\n\u2022 Accreditation offers great learning and educational opportunity. This is achieved \nthrough staff education on best practices and by emphasizing the importance of patient \neducation and patient rights.\n13\nScope of Accreditation Surveys", "through staff education on best practices and by emphasizing the importance of patient \neducation and patient rights.\n13\nScope of Accreditation Surveys\nThe scope of the CBAHI survey includes all standard related functions of the surveyed HCF. Each \nassessment survey is tailored to the type, size and range of services the facility offers. Applicable \nstandards from this manual are determined by CBAHI, based on the scope of  the services provided \nby the HCF undergoing a survey. Additionally, the onsite survey team will  consider the specific \napplicability of individual standards.  \nStandards Development Process \nA standard is a statement of excellence or an explicit predetermined expectation that defines the \nkey functions, activities, processes and structures required for HCFs to ensure the provision of \nsafe, quality care and services. \nStandards are developed by peer experts in their specific field and it is against these standards", "safe, quality care and services. \nStandards are developed by peer experts in their specific field and it is against these standards \nto which conformity of the healthcare facility is evaluated. Simply stated, a standard describes a \nHCF\u2019s acceptable performance level. Within this context, there should be no confusion between \naccreditation standards and licensure standards. When applied to licensure of an individual \npractitioner or organization, the standard is usually set at a minimal level designed to protect \npublic health and safety. Accreditation standards, on the other hand, are designed as optimal and \nachievable. When met, they will establish a high-quality level in a system.\nBroadly speaking, CBAHI standards, as well as those of all other relevant accrediting agencies, \nfocus on three major aspects depending on which area they are addressing. \nStructure;  standards address the system\u2019s inputs, such as manpower, design of the HCF building,", "focus on three major aspects depending on which area they are addressing. \nStructure;  standards address the system\u2019s inputs, such as manpower, design of the HCF building, \nthe availability of personal protective equipment for health workers, such as gloves and masks and \nthe availability of equipment and supplies, such as microscopes and laboratory reagents. \nProcess;  standards address the clinical and administrative activities or interventions carried out \nwithin the HCF in the care of patients or the management of the facility or its staff. Examples \ninclude patient assessment, patient education and medication administration. \nOutcome;  standards involve the assessment of an intervention\u2019s benefits and whether the \nactivity\u2019s expected purpose was achieved. They provide information regarding predicted outcomes \nwhich are being realized.

They provide information regarding predicted outcomes \nwhich are being realized. Examples include patient satisfaction, health-care-associated infections, \nmedication errors, sentinel events and adverse events such as falls and injuries.\nCBAHI standards set expectations for HCF performance which are reasonable, attainable, \nmeasurable and therefore, conducive to a survey. Standards were built to serve as the basis of \nan objective evaluation process that can help HCFs measure, assess and improve performance. \nCBAHI is striving to be a nationally recognized symbol of excellence, respected throughout the \nindustry and by other relevant authorities, as an assurance that accredited HCFs meet rigorous \nstandards of quality and operational integrity that emphasize consumer protection and patient \nengagement. Therefore, the process of standards development at CBAHI follows a long and", "standards of quality and operational integrity that emphasize consumer protection and patient \nengagement. Therefore, the process of standards development at CBAHI follows a long and \nrobust methodology to ensure our standards are correct, evidence-based, relevant and clear. As \nwith previous accreditation books, this book contains standards of quality and patient safety that \nare descriptive in nature and department-oriented.  Specialized task forces develop the first draft \nof CBAHI standards, including focus groups and standards development committees that utilize \ninput from a variety of sources, including:\n\u2022 The standards set by professional scientific societies, both locally and internationally.\n\u2022 Scientific literature review and research studies.\n\u2022 Relevant laws, rules, and regulations.\n\u2022 National (or international) emerging issues related to healthcare quality and patient \nsafety.\n\u2022 Input from healthcare professionals, providers, and patients.", "\u2022 National (or international) emerging issues related to healthcare quality and patient \nsafety.\n\u2022 Input from healthcare professionals, providers, and patients.\n\u2022 Panels of experts and consensus on best practices, given the current state of knowledge \nand technology. \n14\nThe process of standard development can last up to18 months before an initial draft is produced. \nThe draft standards are then distributed nationally for review and made available for comment on \nthe standards Field Review page of the CBAHI website. Based on the feedback received during \nthe field review, the draft standards may be revised and again reviewed by the relevant experts \nand technical committees. The draft standards are finally approved by the Steering Standards \nDevelopment Committee and provided to the CBAHI Board for comments and remarks before \nsubmission to the Saudi Health Council for approval. Thereafter, standards are provided in both \npaper and electronic formats and distributed to HCFs.", "submission to the Saudi Health Council for approval. Thereafter, standards are provided in both \npaper and electronic formats and distributed to HCFs.\nAn e-version is also made available on the CBAHI website. To comply with the guidelines of \nthe International Society for Quality in Healthcare (ISQua), a period of six months is allowed for \npublishing of the standards before they are effective. Once the standards are in effect, ongoing \nfeedback is sought for continuous improvement. The survey process is then tailored to address the \nnew standards, and surveyors are taught how to assess compliance with the standards. \nAccreditation Survey \nCBAHI surveyors typically employ a variety of evaluation techniques and strategies to objectively \ndecide whether the facility meets standards related to key systems and functions, such as \ngovernance and leadership, patient care processes, medication management, infection control,", "decide whether the facility meets standards related to key systems and functions, such as \ngovernance and leadership, patient care processes, medication management, infection control, \nmanagement and safety of the facility environment and quality assurance. For example, the \nsurvey team may review written documents (e.g., strategic and operational plans and budgets, \nand clinical policies and procedures). In addition to reviewing documents, surveyors will interview \nfacility leaders, physicians, nurses, employees and patients to determine the facility\u2019s performance \nand compliance with standards. For example, the surveyor might interview a staff member to \ncheck on the process he or she would complete to report a medical error, that caused harm to one \nof the patients receiving care in that facility. Similarly, a surveyor might interview a patient about \nhis or her level of satisfaction with the care the HCF provides.", "of the patients receiving care in that facility. Similarly, a surveyor might interview a patient about \nhis or her level of satisfaction with the care the HCF provides. \nHCF leaders, including members of the governing body, may be interviewed regarding facility \nprocesses and how they are designed to meet standards related to planning, budgeting, quality \nassurance activities and human resources management. Surveyors tour the facility\u2019s buildings and \npatient care areas to evaluate standards related to overall cleanliness, building safety, fire safety, \nwaste management, equipment and supply management, infection control and emergency \npreparedness. Other diagnostic and support services such as the laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, \ncentral sterile services and day procedure unit are also assessed for safety, effectiveness, quality \ncontrol and equipment management. \nIn summary, during an on-site survey, surveyors use a variety of evaluation approaches to determine", "control and equipment management. \nIn summary, during an on-site survey, surveyors use a variety of evaluation approaches to determine \nthe facility\u2019s compliance or performance regarding applicable structure, process and outcome \nstandards.

Each standard consists of a stem represented by a concise \nstatement. This is followed by one or more sub standards to further illustrate the standard\u2019s \nrequirements. Each substandard is constructed in a way to serve by itself as the evidence of \ncompliance that is going to be measured and scored during the on-site survey. Each standard is \naccompanied by an explanation to help the ambulatory HCFs understand the intent behind it.\nNo matter how robust the methodologies used in building the standards, room for improvement \nwill always exist.

The form allows for continual stakeholder \nfeedback on the standards. This is one of several CBAHI initiatives for improving the efficiency and \neffectiveness of internal processes, including standards development to better meet the needs \nand expectations of our partners.\n16\nSurvey Process \nThe goal of the survey process is to ensure that the CBAHI standards are integrated into the HCF\u2019s \ndaily practices.

Delineation of privileges must be an o ngoing process that should be \nflexible enough to add new procedures or conditions to treat and be firm, fair, and consistent. \nObtaining privileges is the right of all health care providers through an appropriate scheme.  \n \nPrivileging process must start wit h a list of competencies, associated with evidence, checked by the \npractitioner, approved, or modified by the department head and finally discussed for approval by the \ncredentialing and privileging committee of the facility or at times by a centralized cre dentialing and \nprivileging committee approval.

Some of the difficulties \nencountered in the privilege delineation process involve granting privileges for new procedures, \nmonitoring compliance with privileges, and granting privileges that may be performed by members of \nseveral departments.  \n \nThe key to effective privilege delineation is that specific written criteria be applied uniformly to all \nhealthcare providers. Once privileges are granted, they should be disseminated into the different areas \nof the healthcare facility where the practition er will practice. Granted privileges are to be monitored \nthrough performance evaluation, morbidity and mortality committees, infection rates, adverse events", "through performance evaluation, morbidity and mortality committees, infection rates, adverse events \nrelated to the practitioner, etc. In some cases, privileges may be revisited, suspended, or entirel y \nrevoked.  \n \nPrivileging is an internal or institutional issue, varies largely from sector to sector and from provider to \nprovider. Different examples of privileging processes exit in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Some \nhealthcare provider sectors use a cent ralized privileging practice covering its hospitals while others, \nprivileging is left to the hospital itself. Another example is that most hospitals use some form of \u2018laundry \nlist\u2019 for privileging, whereby the healthcare worker is offered a checklist of pr ivileges to choose from \nthat can be initially verified by the Department Head followed by the Credentialing and Privileging \nCommittee (CPC) within this hospital. 1  \n  \nPage 29 of 251", "that can be initially verified by the Department Head followed by the Credentialing and Privileging \nCommittee (CPC) within this hospital. 1  \n  \nPage 29 of 251 \nAlternatively, other hospitals and health providers sectors may conduct competence -based pr ivileging. \nIn this process, the training and experience per each privilege, especially for carrying out advanced or \nhigh -risk medical procedures is thoroughly evaluated in terms of training quality, actual experience, \nand mentoring. Continuous monitoring o f privileges also varies.  \n  \nCredentialing practices vary despite a centralized body, namely the SCFHS. In KSA, issues in \ncredentialing directly lead to flaws in the privileging process. Healthcare facilities are required to \nensure that all practitioners a re credentialed and carry valid licenses.

When occur, the risk of death is greater than 80 \npercent after in -hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for cardiac arrest as indicated in several \nstudies  [5, 6].  \nLife threatening emergencies and events do not happen without warning. Several studies indicate that \nalmost all critical inpatient events are preceded by warning signs for an average of 6 \u20138 hours. [2,7,8]. \nIn multicenter , prospective cohorts, clin ical antecedents, such as a change in vital signs, are present in", "In multicenter , prospective cohorts, clin ical antecedents, such as a change in vital signs, are present in \nthe majority of patients (60 to 70 percent) before in -hospital cardiac arrest occurs [3, 7] and such \nsevere changes in vital signs were found to be associated with a 6.8 -fold increase in mor tality (95% CI \n2.7-17.1) [9]. Simultaneously, studies in the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK[1 -12] estimate that \nadverse events occur in 10% of hospitalized patients with a mortality rate of 5 \u20138%,[8,9].  \nUnfortunately, as many as 50 -70% of these adverse events are judged to be preventable. [8, 13] Of the \navoidable cases, 35 percent had a delay in nursing staff communicating with the physician, and 29 \npercent had a delay in the physician responding to the nurse\u2019s request [13].  \nAnother important factor aff ecting patient outcome in hospitals is Delay in ICU transfer for the critically", "percent had a delay in the physician responding to the nurse\u2019s request [13].  \nAnother important factor aff ecting patient outcome in hospitals is Delay in ICU transfer for the critically \nill in the wards, which is not uncommon [14] and leads to higher mortality when patient transfer to \nhigher levels of care is delayed [15, 16]. In addition, some critically ill patients are either inappropriately \nadmitted to the general ward, rather than to the ICU, from the emergency department or \ndecompensate rapidly shortly after admission. Therefore, these patients\u2019 outcome would improve if \nthey were identified and transferre d earlier to the required higher level of care to facilitate timely \ninterventions and treatment.  \nFor those hospitalized patients experiencing clinical deterioration outside the intensive care unit (ICU), \na mismatch between an acute increase in a patient\u2019s needs and available resources occur [17].", "a mismatch between an acute increase in a patient\u2019s needs and available resources occur [17]. \nRecognizing these patients early, represent a window of opportunity in which to rescue deteriorating \npatients before irreversible morbidity or mortality occurs. This concept of \u201crescue\u201d for the hospitalized \npatient  has led to the development of rapid response systems (RRS) designed to identify and respond \nto deteriorating patients by moving critical personnel, diagnostics, and interventions to the bedside. In  \nPage 137 of 251 \n2004, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) bega n its \u201c100,000 Lives Campaign,\u201d which called \nfor all United States hospitals to deploy rapid response teams [18].

The wide variability of healthcare services \nand population across the Kingdom has made patient transfer an essential part of achieving these \nobjectives.  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has numerous healthcare facilities which include but \nare not limited to hospitals, medica l cities, and specialized centers. As highly specialized care is \ncurrently available mainly in the big cities, the accessibility for such services is very challenging in", "currently available mainly in the big cities, the accessibility for such services is very challenging in \nperipheries without appropriate patient transfer guidelines. Based on Ministry of Heal th (MOH) data, \nthere were around 354,275 transfer requests through the Saudi National Referral System (EHALA) in \n2020. Therefore, the Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions (CBAHI) identified \npatient transfer as a national health priority.  \nPatient transfer is a frequently performed task during care of hospitalized patients. Patient \ntransfer is an essential part of patient care that is usually undertaken to improve patient management. \nTransfers may be due to various reasons such as patients requiring specialized care not available in the \nreferring location or a need for advanced diagnostic skills or equipment. Specialized care that requires \ntransfer could include, for instance, pediatrics neuroscience, spinal injury burns, or a varie ty of other \nspecialties.", "transfer could include, for instance, pediatrics neuroscience, spinal injury burns, or a varie ty of other \nspecialties.  \nFurthermore, patients are often transferred within the same hospital. This may involve \ntransferring patients between hospital units for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, or even for \nconsultation. Patients may come from the Emer gency Department (ED), Operating Rooms (OR), Critical \nCare Units (CCU), wards, or any other hospital areas. During all types of transfers, the main aim is to \nmaintain the continuity of medical care. Patient transfer is particularly challenging when patient s are \nmoved to a new environment with different care settings and staff. In addition, the transfer of an ill \npatient can induce various alterations of the clinical status, such as deterioration of physiological \nparameters including hemodynamic instabilitie s or other vital parameters, or displacement or", "patient can induce various alterations of the clinical status, such as deterioration of physiological \nparameters including hemodynamic instabilitie s or other vital parameters, or displacement or \nmalfunctioning of tubes, lines or equipment which can also adversely affect the status of the patient. \nTherefore, the transfer process should be reviewed thoroughly, and it should be initiated  \nPage 148 of 251 \nsystematically and according to the evidence -based guidelines. The critical elements of safe transfer \ninvolve appropriate decision to transfer and proper communication, pretransfer preparation, \nstabilization, suitable escorts and personnel accompanying the patient, choos ing the proper mode of \ntransport, monitoring equipment during the transfer, accurate and comprehensive documentation and \ncorrect hand -over at the receiving hospital or other facility.  \nIncorrect transfer mechanisms and dynamics can put the patient in a pote ntially dangerous", "correct hand -over at the receiving hospital or other facility.  \nIncorrect transfer mechanisms and dynamics can put the patient in a pote ntially dangerous \nenvironment and has the potential for multiple miscommunication risks. Moreover, the transferring \nteam is mainly operating independently. Hospitals that conduct patients' transfers should ensure \nproper protocols, personnel, equipment, tra ining, and support to ensure the patient's optimal health \nand wellbeing during the transfer process. It is essential that a standardized and complete approach is \ntaken to patient transfer; beginning with the transfer decision until handover of the patient to the \nreceiving unit.  \nMultiple guidelines have been proposed to perform the patient transfer safely. The various \nprofessional bodies have formulated guidelines for safe patient transfer, including the Ministry of \nHealth (MOH), American College of Critical  Care Medicine, American Society of Critical Care Medicine,", "Health (MOH), American College of Critical  Care Medicine, American Society of Critical Care Medicine, \nAssociation of Anesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland, American Society of Anesthesiologist. The \nguidelines emphasized different key elements; however, all the guidelines maintain the principal  goal \nof a safe transfer.  \nWritten transfer protocols and interfacility agreements should be in place, especially when \npatients' transfer is part of a regional plan to provide optimal care at a specialized medical facility.  \nPatient transport is an essential  part of a patient -centered approach of care and positive patient \nexperience. The transfer decision should be undertaken when the benefits of transfer outweigh the \nrisks. The choice of receiving hospitals should be based primarily on specialized care avail ability and \nproximity to the referring hospital. The aim is to seek transfer to a nearby hospital that provides a high", "proximity to the referring hospital. The aim is to seek transfer to a nearby hospital that provides a high \nlevel of quality care. The level of care provided during patient transport should be based on the \npatient's clinical status, national sta ndards and regulations and any anticipated problems. The \ntransport team should have policies and procedures to direct their practice. Documentation of the  \nPage 149 of 251 \ntransport process should be initiated once the transfer decision is made and continued until the \ntran sport process is completed. The transport team should be capable of evaluating the patient's \nresponse during the transport. It is known that education and proper preparation are key to any safe \ntransfer.  \nThe Operating Room (OR) is a critical area in all he althcare facilities with high financial value \nand significant impact. OR transfers require a specific patient's handling process for perioperative", "and significant impact. OR transfers require a specific patient's handling process for perioperative \npatient transfer to maintain efficient flow and proper bed utilization. Furthermore, the OR handles all \npatie nt categories, from different locations, regardless of their current medical condition. Transfers to \nthe OR may come from a variety of locations including Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Pediatric Intensive \nCare Unit (PICU), Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU),  Emergency Department (ED) or other specialty \nareas, thus this variety necessitates a standardized protocol for bidirectional communication and \ntransfer processes.  \nIn addition, the transfer process in OR should maintain a procedure to reduce human factors \naffecting the transfer and patient safety. The goal is to maintain proper situational awareness, proper \ncommunication channels, and closed -loop communication between healthcare providers.", "affecting the transfer and patient safety. The goal is to maintain proper situational awareness, proper \ncommunication channels, and closed -loop communication between healthcare providers.  \nTransporting a critically ill patient is usually associated with sig nificant complications. For any \nhospital to reduce the patient's risks, such transports should be appropriately organized, accompanied \nby the proper personnel and equipment and efficiently done. Guidelines and Protocols for transferring \ncritically ill pati ents should be fully used across all healthcare facilities. In addition, care provided during \ntransportation and at the site of the procedure or diagnostic testing should be equivalent to the care \ndelivered in the originating unit.  \nIt is known that timely transfer of patients from the ICUs to the wards is one aspect of proper \nhand -over, which positively affects overall patient care. Although optimal patient flow is critical to", "hand -over, which positively affects overall patient care. Although optimal patient flow is critical to \nensure quality patient care, there is no clear evidence regarding the best way to  achieve a safe and \nefficient patient transfer from the ICUs, particularly in the pediatric population.  \nAnother consideration to keep in mind is critically ill neonates. Neonates may have absent or \nsmall physiological reserves, which makes them very suscep tible to a life -threatening situation. Such  \nPage 150 of 251 \nthreats may result in adverse physiological changes in these patients during intra - or inter -hospital \ntransport. Ventilator\u2010dependent and hemodynamically unstable patients are at notably higher risk.  \nCareful plan ning is always required to move these critically ill patients between the different \nhospital units such as ICUs, operating theatres, medical imaging rooms, emergency departments, and", "Careful plan ning is always required to move these critically ill patients between the different \nhospital units such as ICUs, operating theatres, medical imaging rooms, emergency departments, and \ngeneral wards. Although, most intra -hospital transfers (defined as transf erring patients between \nhospital units) are elective, the need for urgency should always be anticipated such as moving the \npatient to the operating theatres after a diagnostic procedure.  \nInterfacility transport is defined as the transport of patients betwe en two healthcare \norganizations. The process is generally accomplished through ground transportation.

Critical illness has been crudely estimated to result in several million \ndeaths globally each year. The outcomes of them depends on the sta ndards of care of units hosting \npatients. The importance of ICU becomes clear with the advance of medical and surgical therapies for \ndifferent illness. During disaster and pandemics, the pressure on ICU and the need for organ and lives \nsaving measures paly  a measure and pivotal role in the success to manage such situation and reduce \nmortalities.  \n \nEstablishing an ICU in every institution must match the services, patients\u2019 population, and complexity \nof care.

This transformation is intended to bridge the gap between the current and desired healthcare system. The Kingdom's leadership has been eager to undertake such transformational actions to assure the availability, sufficiency, efficiency, and safety of the healthcare services offered to more than 35 million citizens and residents. The main goal focuses on improving the health of communities whilst increasing the capacity of healthcare services to meet the demands of one of the fastest growing population rates.  The Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions (CBAHI) plays a vital role in the Saudi health system. It is the independent entity responsible for setting the healthcare provision standards and assessing the compliance of healthcare organizations against these standards. CBAHI has strived to establish evidence-based standards that encompass a wide range of healthcare organizations with various scopes, in order to enhance the quality and safety of healthcare services.  The burden of ischemic heart disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality, nationally and internationally. Its burden is increasing due to the high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. This manual is designed to serve healthcare facilities providing acute coronary syndrome services across the country, hence ensuring that the acute coronary syndrome services they provide are effective and meet the desired standards which is of prime importance in terms of quality of care and patient satisfaction. We hope that this manual serves as a road map for administrators and health practitioners providing acute coronary syndrome services in building a patient-centric care system.  CBAHI is a reputable entity that is recognized in the region and internationally for promoting the quality of the Saudi healthcare system through its accreditation process. The International Society for Quality in Healthcare (ISQua) accreditation further adds to CBAHI's standing and its credibility in the healthcare community.  On behalf of all staff members working in the Saudi health sector, I extend our appreciation and gratitude for the limitless support coming from our top leadership to ensure the health and lasting prosperity of the people of Saudi Arabia.

Globally, appealing approaches have been employed to regulate and evaluate healthcare quality internally and externally. Accreditation has been cited as the most used strategic external quality evaluation tool in healthcare. It is a systematic evaluation based on predefined standards that focus on sustainable quality improvement, patient-centeredness, and patient safety. In Saudi Arabia, since its inception in 2005, the Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions (CBAHI) has strived to support healthcare facilities by ensuring continuous compliance with quality and patient safety standards.  Over the last decade or so, the Saudi health system has witnessed significant progress at all levels. One remarkable area was the great expansion in the number and complexity of acute coronary syndrome services. This is in alignment with worldwide advancement in the medical field, with a greater emphasis on continuous performance improvement and measurement. In that, CBAHI is pleased to introduce the first edition of the national standards for acute coronary syndrome services. These evidence-based standards are intended to support healthcare facilities providing acute coronary syndrome services in Saudi Arabia in improving the quality and safety of patient care. Being comprehensive, detailed, and occasionally prescriptive in design and nature, this edition of the standards was built to be relevant and applicable to the licensed healthcare facilities providing acute coronary syndrome services across the country.  During the development of this manual, the development team considered the variety in the quality levels across the continuum of care provided to acute coronary syndrome patients and strived to create a set of standards that would apply to all healthcare facilities providing such services. This manual contains important information on certification eligibility, scheduling of surveys, survey preparation, survey visit, and accreditation/certification decision rules. In the remaining part, certification standards are distributed among relevant chapters.  We sincerely thank the committees, teams, and task forces that contributed to the development, compilation, designing, reviewing, and producing of this manual. We would like also to convey our appreciation to the healthcare professionals who have been obliging and generous with their professional feedback, time, constructive comments, and suggestions.  CBAHI welcomes all stakeholders' perspectives, suggestions, and comments. Only through this constructive collaboration, we can improve the quality and safety of our patients.

Having originally emerged from the Saudi Health Council as a nonprofit organization, CBAHI is primarily responsible for setting quality and safety standards to ensure a better and safer healthcare system. Its first official inauguration occurred after Ministerial Decree number 144187/11 in October 2005, which called for the formation of the Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions, tasked with the initiation of a national voluntary healthcare accreditation program. In 2013, the Council of Ministers mandated accreditation by CBAHI and gave the board its current name.  The mission of CBAHI is to set standards and assess performance for better healthcare, and the vision is to lead healthcare accreditation in the Middle East. CBAHI is aiming to achieve two conjoined initiatives, in congruence with the 2030 vision. The first initiative is to expand the range of efficient and effective accreditation programs to cover healthcare services. The second initiative is to work with a variety of partners to support the health system in Saudi Arabia and the region by increasing the depth of quality improvement and patient safety, as well as, by disseminating knowledge through training and education. Driven by its core values and a dedicated team of surveyors and staff, CBAHI is determined to be a major driving force and a recognized standard for the provision of safe and high-quality healthcare.  In addition to the acute coronary syndrome services certification program, CBAHI currently provides other accreditation programs to healthcare facilities such as primary healthcare centers, hospitals, ambulatory centers, clinical laboratories and blood banks, dental centers, and home healthcare services.  CBAHI is proud to be one of the few healthcare accreditation agencies in the world to be accredited by the International Society for Quality in Healthcare (ISQua).    Healthcare Accreditation/Certification: Definition and Importance   Healthcare accreditation/certification is an assessment process that involves a rigorous, transparent and comprehensive evaluation by an external, independent accreditation body. The healthcare facility (HCF/Service) undergoes an appraisal of its systems, processes, and performance by peer reviewers or surveyors to ensure that all tasks are conducted in a manner that meets applicable predetermined and published national standards. Before the external evaluation, i.e., the survey visit, the HCF/service is expected to conduct a comprehensive self-assessment to determine its level of preparedness and how close it is to achieving full compliance with the standards. Therefore, accreditation/certification represents the healthcare accreditation body's public recognition of the achievement of accreditation standards by an HCF/service. The standards set out a common framework to support HCFs/services to provide effective, timely, and quality services. They are designed to promote the delivery of improved levels of care and treatment to the citizens and residents of Saudi Arabia. Evidence from scientific research shows that engagement in a robust healthcare accreditation program improves the structures, processes, and outcomes of care that healthcare facilities provide. Accreditation/certification is more than just a certificate to be obtained and hung on the wall. Accreditation/certification, when used correctly, can provide the following advantages:  \u2022 Accreditation/certification provides a framework for organizational structure and management. Accreditation/certification standards focus on the governance and leadership structures and many diverse functions within a healthcare facility/service; and the appropriate management of its business and day-to-day activities. \u2022 Accreditation/certification helps improve patient safety and minimizes the risk of medical errors. Ensuring patient safety through risk management and risk reduction is at the center of all accreditation/certification standards and is the ultimate goal of the self-assessment and survey activities. Licensed by CBAHI to:ABEER ALJABER (aal-jaber@moh.gov.sa), Not for email, distribution or reproduction.", "12   \u2022 Accreditation/certification enhances community confidence in the quality and safety of care provided. When a healthcare facility/service achieves accreditation/certification, the message is clear \u2013 its leaders are committed to providing a nationally accepted standard of care in health services delivery. \u2022 Surveyed healthcare facilities/services have found that seeing their operation through the eyes of experienced surveyors gave them a useful, more objective assessment of their internal administrative and clinical processes, as well as effective proposals for improving their processes and the services delivered to the community. \u2022 In the long term, accreditation/certification increases efficiency and enhances lean practices, which in turn leads to decreasing waste and achieving optimal results with less consumption of resources. \u2022 Accreditation/certification helps improve a healthcare facility's/service\u2019s competitiveness. Increased public trust in an accredited facility will encourage more patients to seek care and treatment there. This will increase its market share and improve its competitiveness in the healthcare sector. \u2022 Achieving accreditation/certification will fulfil the regulations required by the national authorities as CBAHI national accreditation currently is linked to the licensing of healthcare facilities. \u2022 Accreditation/certification has a link to reimbursement from insurers and other third parties. There is a growing tendency, nationally and internationally, to link accreditation/certification with eligibility for insurance reimbursement. \u2022 Accreditation/certification provides a robust tool for continuous quality improvement efforts in healthcare facilities/services and assists facility leadership to ensure the sustainability of quality improvement projects and initiatives. \u2022 Accreditation/certification provides excellent learning and educational opportunities. This is accomplished by educating staff on best practices and emphasizing the importance of patient education and patient rights.       Scope of Certification Survey  The scope of the CBAHI survey includes all standard-related functions of the surveyed ACS service. Each assessment survey is tailored to the type, size, and range of services offered. Any special medical procedures/services performed in the acute coronary syndrome services covered in any other CBAHI set of standards should also be followed. This might include services like pharmacy services and medication use/prescription, and so on.  A standard is a statement of excellence or an explicit predetermined expectation that defines the essential functions, activities, processes, and structures required for the services to ensure the provision of safe, quality care and services.  Peer experts in their specific fields develop standards. It is against these standards that the conformity of the ACS service is evaluated. Stated succinctly, a standard describes an ACS service\u2019s acceptable performance level. Within this context, there should be no confusion between certification standards and licensure standards. When applied to the licensure of an individual practitioner or facility, the licensure standard is usually set at a minimal level designed to protect public health and safety. Certification standards, on the other hand, are designed as optimal and achievable. When met, standards establish a high-quality level in a system.  CBAHI standards and those of all other relevant accrediting agencies focus on three significant aspects depending on which area they are addressing structure, process, and outcome:  Structure: standards related to structure address the system's inputs, such as workforce, building design, and the availability of equipment and supplies such as personal protective equipment.  Process: standards address the clinical and administrative processes or interventions carried out within the facility/service in terms of patient care, facility management, or staff management. Examples include patient assessment, patient education, and medication administration.  Licensed by CBAHI to:ABEER ALJABER (aal-jaber@moh.gov.sa), Not for email, distribution or reproduction.", "13   Outcome: standards related to outcome involve assessing an intervention's benefits and whether the activity's expected purpose was achieved. They provide information regarding predicted outcomes that are being realized. Examples include data regarding patient satisfaction, healthcare-associated infections, medication errors, and adverse events.  CBAHI standards set expectations for ACS service\u2019s performance that are reasonable, attainable, measurable, and therefore, conducive to a survey. Standards were built to serve as the basis of an objective evaluation process that can help ACS services measure, assess, and improve performance. CBAHI strives to be a nationally recognized symbol of excellence, respected throughout the industry and by other relevant authorities as an assurance that certified ACS services meet rigorous standards of quality and operational integrity that emphasize consumer protection and patient engagement. Therefore, the standards development process at CBAHI follows a long and robust methodology to ensure our standards are correct, evidence-based relevant, and straightforward.  There are a variety of methodologies or approaches that have been used globally for healthcare accreditation/certification standards development such as department-oriented standards, scope of services-oriented standards, or quality system essentials. The National Standards for Acute Coronary Syndrome services contain standards of quality and patient safety that are descriptive in nature. Standards are included in three chapters: Leadership of the service (LD), Provision of Care (PC), and Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory (CCL). These standards and the surveyor programs aim to provide answers to the following four questions: \u2022 Is the ACS service well-led? \u2022 Is the care delivered safe, effective, and patient-centered? \u2022 Is the environment, in which the ACS care is provided, safe and suitable? \u2022 Are the internal and external customers satisfied?  CBAHI used a 'hybrid methodology' to help answer these four questions positively. Some of the standards are departmental-based, whereas others are based on quality metrics to ensure standards implementation, environmental safety, and internal and external customer satisfaction. Specialized task forces, including focus groups and standards development committees, develop the first draft of CBAHI standards. A variety of sources are utilized including: \u2022 The standards set by professional scientific societies, both locally and internationally. \u2022 Scientific literature review and research studies. \u2022 Relevant laws, rules, and regulations. \u2022 National (or international) emerging issues related to healthcare quality and patient safety. \u2022 Input from healthcare professionals, providers, and patients. \u2022 Panels of experts and consensus on best practices, given the current state of knowledge and technology. \u2022 Environmental inspection. \u2022 Evaluation results from previous surveys, if available.  The process of standard development can last several months before an initial draft is produced. The draft standards are then distributed nationally for review and made available for comment on the standards through a field review process. Based on the feedback received during the field review, the draft standards may be revised and again reviewed by the relevant experts and technical committees. The draft standards are finally reviewed and approved by the Standards Development Steering Committee and provided to the CBAHI Board for comments and remarks before submission to the Saudi Health Council for approval. Thereafter, the standards are made available to the target facilities/ services and an e-version is made available too on the CBAHI website.  To comply with the guidelines of the International Society for Quality in Healthcare (ISQua), a period of six months is allowed for the publishing of the standards before they are effective. Through this, ACS services are given adequate time to familiarize themselves with and implement the standards. Also, CBAHI surveyors are taught how to assess compliance with these standards.  No matter how robust the methodologies used in developing the standards, room for improvement will always exist. Therefore, once the standards are in effect, ongoing feedback is sought for continuous improvement purposes. This is one of several CBAHI initiatives for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of internal processes, including standards development to better meet the needs and expectations of our partners.

CBAHI surveyors typically employ a variety of techniques and strategies to objectively decide whether the ACS service meets the standards related to key systems and functions such as leadership, patient care processes, medication management, infection prevention and control, and safety of the facility environment. For example, the survey team may review written documents such as strategic and operational plans and budgets as well as clinical policies and procedures. In addition to reviewing documents, surveyors will interview ACS service leaders, physicians, nurses, employees, and patients to determine the ACS service\u2019s performance and compliance with standards. For example, the surveyor might interview a staff member to check on the process he or she would complete to report a medical error that caused harm to any of the patients receiving care in that facility. Similarly, a surveyor might interview a patient about his or her level of satisfaction with the care ACS service provides.  The ACS service leaders may be interviewed regarding ACS service processes and how they are designed to meet standards related to planning, budgeting, quality improvement activities, and human resources management. Surveyors tour the facility's buildings and patient care areas to evaluate standards related to overall cleanliness, building safety, fire safety, waste management, equipment and supply management, infection control, and emergency preparedness. Diagnostic and support services such as the laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, and central sterile services are also assessed for safety, effectiveness, and quality control.  In summary, during an on-site survey, surveyors use a variety of evaluation approaches to determine the ACS service\u2019s compliance or performance regarding applicable structure, process, and outcome standards. These methods might include any combination of the following: \u2022 Interviews with the ACS service leadership, clinical and support staff, patients, and families. \u2022 Observation of patient care and services. \u2022 Facility tour and observation of patient care areas, building facilities, equipment management, and diagnostic testing services. \u2022 Review of written documents such as policies and procedures, orientation and training plans, budgets, and quality improvement plans. \u2022 Review of staff personnel files. \u2022 Review of patient medical records. \u2022 Evaluation of the ACS service achievement of specific outcome measures (e.g., acquired infection rates, patient satisfaction) through review and discussion of monitoring and improvement activities.    Structure of the National Standards for Acute Coronary Syndrome Service  The National Standards for Acute Coronary Syndrome Service (ACS) is assembled into three chapters consisting of critical services and functions of ACS services provided in Saudi Arabia. The standards within these chapters are arranged according to the workflow within the services. The chapters are: \u2022 Leadership of the Service (LD) \u2022 Provision of Care (PC) \u2022 Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory (CCL)   Each chapter includes a brief introduction that explains the chapter's relevance and contribution to safety and quality patient care. Each standard consists of a stem standard that consists of a concise statement, followed by a number of sub-standards to further illustrate the standard's requirements. Each sub-standard is constructed to independently serve as the evidence of compliance that is going to be measured and scored during the on-site survey. Each standard is accompanied by an explanation to help the ACS services understand the intent behind it.

The agreement ensures that the receiving hospital/center has a \u201cNo refusal policy\u201d to accept transferred ACS patients. \u2022 The cardiac catheterization laboratory operates 24/7 for both diagnostic and therapeutic coronary procedures. \u2022 The service has access to comprehensive radiology and clinical laboratory services. \u2022 The service has a dedicated general cardiology ward and cardiac care unit/ intensive care unit. \u2022 The service has a cardiac rehabilitation service, on-site or outsourced. \u2022 The service has an outpatient preventive cardiology service. \u2022 The service has been in full operation for at least 12 months before the certification on-site survey. \u2022 The service completes and returns an ACS certification application form.    Registration with CBAHI  Registration with CBAHI for certification is required for all eligible ACS services. This is the first step towards certification. The ACS service is required to register by completing the registration form located on CBAHI's website. Registration is a quick yet essential step that provides the Healthcare Accreditation Department at CBAHI with the necessary information about the registering ACS service. A system-generated autoreply with a code number will be provided to the registering ACS service upon successful registration. This code number will subsequently be used for all future communications with CBAHI.    Certification Pathway  To obtain CBAHI ACS certification, the ACS service must complete several activities. Upon successful registration, the manual of the national standards for ACS will be provided to the ACS service seeking CBAHI certification.  Each year CBAHI decides on which ACS service to be visited in its specific certification program, based on the operational plan and the certification cycle, for that particular year. CBAHI will notify those ACS services included in its yearly certification plan by the manner of a letter of enrolment.  CBAHI provides ongoing ACS service orientation programs in different locations throughout the year. The ACS services are encouraged to attend at least one of these orientation programs. Although any facility that provides ACS service can attend, preference is given to facilities selected for the current year's certification plan. During these orientation sessions, certification policies and survey processes are explained in detail. In that, ACS service representatives are given the opportunity to enquire about the intent of standards and how they should be implemented. The dates and venues of the orientation programs will be communicated to the facilities that provide ACS service promptly.  All ACS services enrolled in the ACS certification program are encouraged to conduct a comprehensive self-assessment using the Self-Assessment Tool (SAT) that CBAHI provides upon registering for certification. This tool is intended to help the ACS service assess how close it is to satisfactory compliance with the standards and requirements. It also provides an idea of how much preparation and time the ACS service needs before the real survey visit. If objectively and effectively conducted, self-assessment provides better insight into the baseline situation of each ACS service and provides a common communication tool between the facility seeking ACS certification and the accrediting body. As a rule, the SAT is for the ACS service's internal use, but CBAHI might require it before conducting the survey to help determine the level of preparedness.  Licensed by CBAHI to:ABEER ALJABER (aal-jaber@moh.gov.sa), Not for email, distribution or reproduction.", "20   Some ACS services may choose to have a mock survey visit. This visit is offered by CBAHI mainly as an educational tool by experienced peer surveyors to clarify certification policies, standards, and intents. In addition to determining the applicability of the certification standards and verifying the self-assessment's findings. It should be noted, however, that mock surveys are subject to the available resources at CBAHI and the level of commitment demonstrated by the ACS service toward achieving compliance with the standards.  The ACS service may choose to participate directly in an on-site real survey visit. The time interval between registration and the achievement of certification is 6 to 18 months, on average. The ACS service is allowed to have a maximum of (2) on-site survey attempts within (2) years time frame. Therefore, the ACS service that will eventually prove incapable of achieving certification, as reasonably persuaded by CBAHI, will be suspended temporarily from participation in the national certification program.  Once an ACS service has applied for an on-site real certification survey visit and completed the pre-survey requirements as mentioned above, the tentative year of the visit will be determined based on CBAHI operational plan and communicated to the ACS service by the registration department. As CBAHI real certification visits are unannounced, the ACS service will be notified about the date of the survey and the survey team, seven days before the date of the real survey. However, the time frame may be extended in some circumstances.  In all cases, the service agreement must be acknowledged and duly signed by the facility/service and a copy returned to CBAH, and the ACS service must provide evidence of payment of the required certification fee.   Survey Team  To earn and maintain ACS certification, the ACS service must undergo an on-site survey conducted by the CBAHI survey team. CBAHI handles all scheduling arrangements for surveys in coordination with the ACS service leaders. The date of the survey visit will be determined following CBAHI's yearly operational plan.  Generally, the survey team is composed of one or two healthcare professionals, who specialized in the surveyed service. However, the size of the survey team members and the duration of the visit might change according to the size and scope of the ACS service.  The survey is conducted under the leadership of a visit team leader (VTL) that has been designated by CBAHI. The visit team leader is responsible for assuring that all survey activities are completed within the specified timeframe and according to CBAHI's policies and survey guide. The ACS service under survey is required to facilitate the work of the survey team members and to allow the visit team leader to practice his/her role and responsibilities, which include: \u2022 Preparing and communicating the survey plan to the ACS service. \u2022 Chairing the opening and closing meetings. \u2022 Communicating with the ACS service leadership regarding survey progress and initial findings. \u2022 Evaluating team progress and adjusting survey plans as needed; when required. \u2022 Coordinating and preparing the survey report and submitting it to CBAHI.    Licensed by CBAHI to:ABEER ALJABER (aal-jaber@moh.gov.sa), Not for email, distribution or reproduction.", "21   Rescheduling of Surveys  ACS service scheduled for a survey is strongly encouraged to adhere to the survey date set by CBAHI. However, rescheduling may be considered for review at CBAHI's discretion on a case-by-case basis and following the postponement of the certification survey policy.  CBAHI makes every possible effort to carry out survey visits as per schedule. Under limited circumstances, postponement may be considered if the two conditions of accepting postponement exist. The two conditions are a justifiable cause, and an official letter reaching CBAHI at least 60 calendar days prior to the survey date. Justifiable causes may include: \u2022 Significant natural or internal disasters (e.g., food, thunder, earthquake, major fire). \u2022 Major renovation work that hinders the daily operation of the service. \u2022 A mandate to stop the ACS service operation by a governmental authority. \u2022 Change of ownership or affiliation (e.g., merge) within 6 months prior to the date of the survey. \u2022 Relocation of the service to another building/campus within 6 months prior to the date of the survey. \u2022 State of war when the healthcare facility/service might be affected or involved.  In all cases, postponement must not exceed 6 months. For an extended period, in case the postponement cause still exists, approval from the CBAHI is required.     Certification Decision Rules  In general, the ACS service must meet all applicable standards at an acceptable level to be certified. CBAHI utilizes a multilevel process for making certification and recertification decisions. This is to ensure fairness, consistency, objectivity, and accuracy. As such, CBAHI benefits from any relevant report and/or significant finding or issue related to the surveyed ACS service that was brought to CBAHI's attention by relevant health authorities or previous certification surveys.  Certification decisions are released and communicated to the ACS service within 30 days after the conclusion of the survey visit. The certification decision-making process is based on: \u2022 The findings of the survey team members as recorded in the survey report. \u2022 The factual accuracy review of the draft report by the participating ACS service of any issue of fact found in the report before the certification decision is made. \u2022 Review/discussion during the meeting of the accreditation decision committee (ADC) for a significant finding that makes the survey outcome undetermined. This committee may request additional evidence before making a final recommendation for an accreditation/certification decision. All accreditation/certification decisions are then ratified by the CBAHI Director General.  It is important to note that the decision to grant certification is based primarily on the findings of the on-site survey as recorded by the surveyors in the survey report. However, the overall numerical score of the ACS service performance is one important factor, among others, upon which the ADC members rely when making their recommendations. Other factors include the non-compliant standard(s); for example, the degree of severity and immediacy of risk to patients, families, or staff safety.  Criticality has several levels. The most serious is when the surveyor notices an immediate threat to safety or quality of care. Examples include expired material being used, a bare electrical wire hanging down without any protection, and a patient not properly identified. When a CBAHI surveyor notices an immediate threat, whether or not it is directly linked to the standards, the survey team leader will notify the ACS service director and include the findings in the survey report.  Each standard is composed of a stem statement and sub-standard/s. The sub-standard is the measurable element to be scored by the surveyor during the on-site survey. Each sub-standard has equal weight and is scored on a numerical scale as set by CBAHI policies. Licensed by CBAHI to:ABEER ALJABER (aal-jaber@moh.gov.sa), Not for email, distribution or reproduction.", "22   The overall score is calculated using the sum of the scores of all the applicable sub-standards divided by the maximum score. When one or more standards of this manual do not apply to a particular ACS service, they are indicated as \"Not Applicable (NA).\" Non-applicable standards are not scored and are not included in either the numerator or denominator of the overall score.   The decision committee shall recommend one of the following certification decisions:  Certified  Certification will be awarded when the surveyed ACS service demonstrates overall acceptable compliance with all applicable standards at the time of the initial (or re-certification) on-site survey, and when there are no criticality or concern related to non-compliant standard(s) that may impact the safety of patients, families, staff, or the service itself. Certification will also be recommended when the ACS service has successfully addressed all post-survey requirements and does not meet any rules for denial.   Denial of Certification  Denial of certification results when the ACS service shows significant noncompliance with the certification standards at the time of the on-site survey. It also results if one or more of the other reasons leading to the denial of certification have not been resolved. When the ACS service is denied certification, it is prohibited from participating in the certification program for six months unless CBAHI, for good reason, waives all or a portion of the prohibition period. Factors cited as reasons leading to the denial of certification include: \u2022 The overall score is less than the minimum required score as set by CBAHI policies.  \u2022 The presence of an immediate threat, to the safety of patients, families, or staff, is observed by CBAHI surveyors during the on-site survey. \u2022 Failure to submit the post-survey requirements promptly. \u2022 The ACS service was subjected to a focused survey but still could not meet the requirements for certification. \u2022 Reasonable evidence exists of fraud, plagiarism, or falsified information related to the certification process. Falsification is defined as the fabrication of any information (given by verbal communication or paper/electronic document) provided to CBAHI by an applicant or certified service through redrafting, additions, or deletions of a document's content without proper attribution. CBAHI perceives plagiarism as the deliberate use of another facility/service's original (not common knowledge) material without acknowledging its source. \u2022 Refusal by the facility to conduct the survey.   Appeal Against a Certification Decision  A surveyed ACS service can appeal against the following certification outcomes: \u2022 Denial of certification provided this is not due to a failure to submit the post-survey requirements promptly after granting certification or a failure to meet requirements after a follow-up focused survey. \u2022 Suspension/revocation of certification.  All appeals shall be made within a maximum of 15 calendar days from receipt of the official survey report by submitting a cover letter to be sent from the facility director or ACS service director to the CBAHI Director General via registered mail/fast courier. This should include documentation to support the argument for the appeal and a completed Appeal Request Form (ARF) located on CBAHI's portal. Letters sent via electronic mail or facsimile will not be considered.  Licensed by CBAHI to:ABEER ALJABER (aal-jaber@moh.gov.sa), Not for email, distribution or reproduction.", "23   Grounds for Appeal   The ACS service is entitled to an appeal if the appeal is based on one or more of the following grounds: \u2022 Relevant and significant information which was available to the survey team was not considered in the making of the certification decision. \u2022 The report of the surveyors was inconsistent with the information presented to the survey team. \u2022 The existence of perceived bias among the surveyor(s). \u2022 The outcome of the appeal, if in favor of the appealing ACS service, will result in a change in the certification status. CBAHI will not consider appeals that will not result in a change of certification status.  Initial acceptance of the appeal request can occur only when clear and convincing evidence indicates that the ACS service meets at least one of the grounds for appeal. The appeal request shall set forth the specific grounds for the request and shall include a statement of the reasons for each ground, along with any other relevant statements or documents the facility/service desires to include. ACS services applying for an appeal must identify the specific alleged procedural failures or the specific manner in which the decision was arbitrary or unreasonable and not based on, or consistent with, CBAHI standards and policies. Accepted appeals, including all relevant reports and evidence, are thoroughly studied by the appeal committee. One of the following decisions shall be made and communicated to the appealing ACS service promptly: \u2022 The adverse decision is upheld. \u2022 The ACS service's appeal is upheld, and the denial of certification is modified or reversed. In this circumstance, a full or focused re-survey may be conducted.     Certification Maintenance (Post-Survey Requirements)  CBAHI has redesigned its certification to represent a continuous process versus a once-every-three-year evaluation. Certified ACS services must maintain their certification status by showing their continued compliance with the standards and requirements of CBAHI throughout the certification cycle and following the specified time frames. This translates into standing and ad hoc requirements:  Standing Requirements for Accreditation/ Certification Maintenance  \u2022 Corrective Action Plan (CAP)   When certification is awarded to an ACS service, a corrective action plan (CAP) addressing some or all standards that were not in satisfactory compliance during the on-site survey will be requested by CBAHI for review and acceptance within a specified time frame from the date of the certification decision. The CAP ideally focuses on demonstrating what has been done rather than what will be done. The CAP addresses all non-compliant standards, the requirements for improvement, the corrective actions that have been or will be taken (with dates and responsible individuals) and, as applicable, the monitoring measures to ensure the sustainability of the actions taken. A delay in the submission of the CAP that exceeds 30 days beyond the due date without justification can result in the suspension of the certification.  \u2022 Midterm Self-Assessment  Certified ACS services must participate in a mid-cycle self-evaluation of standards compliance known as the Midterm Self-Assessment. Fifteen months from the date of certification, the ACS service should start utilizing the self-assessment tool to assist in the periodic review of its performance against the standards. The ACS service then has three months to complete the assessment.  Licensed by CBAHI to:ABEER ALJABER (aal-jaber@moh.gov.sa), Not for email, distribution or reproduction.", "24   Completion of the midterm assessment will allow the ACS service to identify areas of standard non-compliance and create a plan for correction of deficient areas to ensure the ACS service comes into compliance before the next on-site survey. For those areas self-identified as non-compliant with CBAHI standards, the ACS service is required to submit a CAP to CBAHI that includes evidence to substantiate the fact that the standard has been brought into compliance. The relevant department at CBAHI will review each plan of action to indicate whether the plan and timetables are acceptable for bringing the standard into compliance.  A delay in submitting the midterm assessment by more than 60 days from the due date without an acceptable justification to CBAHI will result in the suspension of certification, followed by revocation of certification if the total delay exceeds 90 days.  During the next on-site visit following the submission of the midterm assessment, the surveyor will look for evidence of compliance/correction that the ACS service provided as part of the plan of action. When there is a legitimate concern about the safety and quality of services provided by a certified ACS service at the time of the mid-term assessment, CBAHI may require the ACS service to undergo a mid-cycle survey (a fee will be charged to cover costs) and to submit a plan of action for areas of non-compliance.   Ad Hoc Requirements for Accreditation Maintenance  \u2022 Reporting of a sentinel event When a sentinel event occurs, as defined by CBAHI, in an accredited facility, it must be reported immediately. A subsequent root cause analysis (RCA), and the risk reduction action must be submitted within the time frame defined by CBAHI.  A sentinel event is defined as any event leading to serious patient harm or death that is caused by healthcare rather than the patient's underlying illness. By investigating sentinel events, one can identify deficiencies in healthcare systems and processes and put actions in place to prevent a recurrence. CBAHI calls for the following concerning sentinel events: \u2022 Open disclosure/open communication. Patients and their families are entitled at all times to truthful and transparent communication and explanation of any sentinel events happening to them. \u2022 When a reportable sentinel event occurs in an ACS service certified by CBAHI, the ACS service must provide evidence of reporting to CBAHI. ACS services that are not certified by CBAHI are not required to report. In addition to reporting, CBAHI may become aware of the occurrence of a sentinel event through communication from one of CBAHI's surveyors, the media, a patient or relative, the facility's employees, or through other means of communication. \u2022 CBAHI is interested in knowing about reportable sentinel events when they occur in certified ACS services for learning and disseminating lessons learned to the medical community, thereby avoiding the recurrence of such events in the future. Medical errors and adverse events are opportunities for education and quality improvements. \u2022 Reporting must be safe. Patients, families, and staff are encouraged and should be empowered by the facility leadership and ACS service leadership to report any sentinel event without fear of retribution. CBAHI has zero tolerance for certified ACS services taking disciplinary actions against a staff member who reports a sentinel event. If the disciplinary action proves to be related to reporting, this can negatively impact the ACS service certification status. \u2022 The outcome of a reported sentinel event is dependent on the level of commitment the facility/ACS service demonstrates towards studying the root cause(s) of the incident and re-designing its processes and systems to prevent a recurrence. When CBAHI is persuaded of this constructive approach by the concerned ACS service in dealing with sentinel events, certification is usually maintained. When this is not the case, CBAHI will pursue this further to decide on the ACS service eligibility to maintain its certification until the required corrections are made. In situations where the certification is valid for less than six months and CBAHI is not persuaded that the corrections have been made, an early full re-certification survey may be warranted.    Licensed by CBAHI to:ABEER ALJABER (aal-jaber@moh.gov.sa), Not for email, distribution or reproduction.", "25   \u2022 Notification of significant changes  Certified ACS services must notify CBAHI in writing about any significant structural, functional, or regulatory changes that took place after the certification survey was conducted. Written notification should be submitted no more than 30 days after the initiation/occurrence of such changes through the CBAHI portal. Subsequently, CBAHI will evaluate the impact of these changes and a decision for conducting a focused survey may be warranted accordingly. These changes include, but are not limited to the following: \u2022 A national regulatory body has mandated closure for all or part of the ACS service. \u2022 ACS service is not in compliance anymore with other relevant rules and regulations. \u2022 ACS service certification by other international accrediting organizations has been suspended or revoked. \u2022 Any of the services are being offered in a new location or branch. \u2022 Major construction, destruction, or renovation work has been undertaken in any of the facility's buildings, floors, or units, where ACS services are provided. \u2022 A significant increase (30% or above) or decrease in the volume of services/bed capacity has been experienced.   Certification Suspension and Revocation  CBAHI expects nothing but the truth, honesty, and sincere intentions in all dealings and propositions from ACS services engaged in its certification program. This \"good faith\" engagement applies continuously throughout the certification cycle. The ACS service must ensure that it is not violated. In addition, certified ACS services must maintain the same momentum both before and after certification. Some might argue that it is a natural tendency to ease back after a survey visit. However, compliance with the standards must not drop simply because the survey is completed, and certification has been awarded. Should CBAHI become aware, by any means of a certified ACS service that is not in compliance with the standards, CBAHI will verify the situation and take appropriate action.   CBAHI may receive information regarding possible violations by certified ACS services through several channels; most importantly reports of related government agencies, written or verbal complaints, and the media. Types of violations include, but are not limited to, the following: \u2022 CBAHI becomes aware of an immediate threat to the safety of patients or staff in a certified ACS service. \u2022 The ACS service is not committed to the specified time frames for certification, for example, maintenance of timely submission of a corrective action plan after certification or timely submission of a midterm self-assessment. \u2022 The ACS service failed to report a sentinel event as per the relevant policy without an acceptable justification. \u2022 The ACS service is committing an act of misuse (see the policy on certificate and seal), deception, or any deliberate misrepresentation of the truth (see the policy on truthfulness and the ethics clause). \u2022 The ACS service is discouraging communication or taking disciplinary action/reprisal against patients or staff members trying to communicate directly with CBAHI about safety or quality of care concerns.  \u2022 The ACS service intentionally lacks commitment to continuous compliance with CBAHI standards. This complacent behavior is incompatible with the CBAHI certification process. \u2022 The ACS service is deliberately violating any of the other certification policies mentioned in this manual or other supporting documents and manuals provided by CBAHI for certification.  Once CBAHI is convinced that one or more of the above-mentioned violations exists in a certified ACS service, it responds by taking one of the following actions, in any order: \u2022 Issuing a letter of \"At Risk of Suspension of Certification\" \u2022 Suspension of certification \u2022 Revocation of certification  Licensed by CBAHI to:ABEER ALJABER (aal-jaber@moh.gov.sa), Not for email, distribution or reproduction.", "26   CBAHI determines the level of response to a specific violation based on several factors, including the severity of the violation, its frequency, previous certification history, the source of information regarding the violation, and the findings and conclusion of CBAHI's inquiry. When necessary, a focused or complete survey might be conducted for validation before a response can be given or an action taken. This kind of survey is always for one or more of the above causes (e.g., when concerns have been raised about a certified service's continued compliance with CBAHI standards). A certified service may undergo a survey at any time, at the discretion of CBAHI, and the survey is usually unscheduled (the ACS service receives 48 hours' notice before the survey) or unannounced (without advance notice), depending on the seriousness and type of violation. Surveys can include either all ACS services or only those areas in which a severe concern may exist. ACS services are usually charged for these surveys, regardless of the outcome. Results can affect the ACS service's certification status. If the ACS service does not allow CBAHI surveyors to conduct the survey, CBAHI may change the ACS service\u2019s status to Revocation of Certification.  It should be noted that when the ACS service certification is suspended, the ACS service can regain certification once the causative violation has been rectified. However, the suspension will not be lifted before a probation period of more than 12 months from the date of suspension. Revocation of certification is a more severe consequence that prohibits participation in the CBAHI certification as per CBAHI policy. In both, suspension and revocation of certification, CBAHI will communicate the new certification decision to the relevant authorities and display it on its website. CBAHI, for a good reason, can waive all or a portion of the prohibition period.    Random Surveys   To support CBAHI's ongoing quality assurance initiatives, a certified ACS service may be selected for a random unannounced survey at any time after the certification survey. A sample of 5% of all certified ACS services is randomly selected each year for this activity. These random, unannounced surveys are a means by which CBAHI evaluates the consistency and quality of its program, while also demonstrating to the public and regulators that certified ACS services remain committed to CBAHI standards throughout the certification cycle. Random surveys also provide CBAHI and its surveyors with opportunities to further assess the certified ACS services in the interval between regular surveys. No fee shall be charged to the ACS service when a random survey is conducted.  The ACS services may be selected for a validation survey visit as part of an inter-rater reliability program for CBAHI surveyors within one month after receipt of the certification decision report. The visit outcome has no impact on the certification status granted in the actual certification survey visit. The ACS service will not bear any financial cost.    Certification Certificate and Seal  Once certification is granted, ACS services are encouraged to display the CBAHI logo, certificate, and seal on the facility's/service\u2019s bulletin boards, banners, website, newsletters, brochures, and headed stationery denoting their certification status.  CBAHI requires all certified ACS services to follow the guidelines and conditions for the appropriate use of the CBAHI logo, certificate, and seal. Specifically, CBAHI works to ensure that no certification material is used in a way that may mislead the public or others or provide false information related to certification status.  The Guidelines for proper use of the CBAHI logo and certificate include the following: \u2022 The printing of the certification seal is accurate and legible, with no degradation or distortion. \u2022 The size of the CBAHI logo and its certification seal should remain in the same permitted proportion as that provided. \u2022 The CBAHI logo, certificate, and seal should be used in the same format, with no added graphics or words. Licensed by CBAHI to:ABEER ALJABER (aal-jaber@moh.gov.sa), Not for email, distribution or reproduction.", "27   \u2022 The ACS service abides by the same colors used in the CBAHI logo, or black and white when the logo is used for certain printed materials such as newspaper advertisements, newsletters, brochures, flyers, and posters. \u2022 The ACS service is prohibited from using the CBAHI logo or certification seal on business cards.  Upon expiry of the certificate validity period or suspension/revocation of the certification, the ACS service shall immediately take action to refrain from using the CBAHI logo, certificate, and seal.    Release of Certification-Related Confidential Information  CBAHI asserts that ACS services undergoing its certification survey are expected to provide access to information related to the evaluation of their compliance with CBAHI standards. As a guiding policy to ACS services engaged in any certification programs, CBAHI commits to keeping all information obtained or received during the certification process confidential, including all survey data and information that surveyors come across during the survey process.  For an ACS service that is a participating member of the CBAHI certification program, some information is subject to public release. This includes the ACS service certification status and the standards under which the certification survey was conducted. Other certification-related information is not subject to public release except to the ACS service on a question. The exception to this rule is when the CBAHI receives an official request for clarification from relevant health authorities or public health agencies. This information includes: \u2022 Decision committee minutes and agenda materials. \u2022 The certificates. \u2022 The post-survey requirements, including any CAPs. \u2022 The results of investigations related to a sentinel event, including the root cause analysis prepared in response to that event. \u2022 The results of investigations involved falsified information the ACS service provided to CBAHI. \u2022 Other information related to compliance with CBAHI standards obtained from the ACS service before, during, or after the certification survey.    Complaints Against Certified ACS Service  CBAHI is interested in collecting information from a variety of sources to improve the quality and safety of all certified ACS services. These sources include complaints from patients, their families, staff, government agencies, the media, and the public. Staff members at ACS service certified by CBAHI must be informed that they may make complaints directly to CBAHI without fear of retaliatory actions from their complaints.  CBAHI addresses all complaints that would help identify possible noncompliance with its certification standards, thereby posing a possible threat to the safety of patients, staff, or the public. More precisely, CBAHI can evaluate complaint information only in terms of its relevance to compliance with CBAHI's standards. Issues of personal nature or individual disputes should be dealt with by the concerned facility/service or the regional health authority. CBAHI cannot follow up on complaints about ACS services that are not certified.  When CBAHI receives a complaint against a certified ACS service, CBAHI will conduct an initial screening to determine its relevance to compliance with CBAHI standards and its impact on patient safety. If the complaint does not relate to compliance with CBAHI standards, a response of \"non-relevance\" will be forwarded to the complainant, who will be advised to forward the complaint to the ACS service leadership or the regional health authority. If the complaint relates to compliance with one of the CBAHI standards, a response shall be made accordingly. The response will depend on a risk assessment matrix that determines the probability and severity of the complaint. CBAHI will check for any other complaints regarding the same facility/ACS service. Broadly speaking, CBAHI will give one or both of the following responses: Licensed by CBAHI to:ABEER ALJABER (aal-jaber@moh.gov.sa), Not for email, distribution or reproduction.", "28   \u2022 CBAHI may write to the ACS service about the complaint. When requested, the ACS service must make available its records of complaints and subsequent actions taken. \u2022 CBAHI may decide to visit the ACS service to verify whether a problem exists in terms of standards compliance involved in the complaint. Such visits are usually unannounced, and the outcome may change the certification decision.  It is CBAHI policy not to disclose any information related to patients or complainants unless it is authorized to do so. In addition to information about the complaint's relevance to CBAHI standards, the complainant will receive the following information: \u2022 The course of action CBAHI took regarding the complaint. \u2022 Whether CBAHI has decided to act regarding the ACS service certification decision following the completion of the complaint's investigation.  To file a complaint against a certified ACS service, an individual can send his/her concern via the contact form on the CBAHI website. The individual can also file the complaint directly by calling the Universal Access Number 920012512. CBAHI requires that the complainant reveals his/her identity. Therefore, CBAHI will not consider anonymous complaints.   Conflict of Interest  CBAHI works to ensure the integrity and fairness of all businesses conducted by employees working in the central office as well as the surveyors. In addition, all healthcare facilities/services engaged in the CBAHI accreditation/certification process are required to refrain from any actual or potential act or behavior that might create a conflict of interest, including: \u2022 Proposing any fee, remuneration, gift, or gratuity of any value to CBAHI employees or surveyors for the performance of their duties or survey-related activities. \u2022 Employing, contracting, or having any financial relationship with CBAHI employees or surveyors to provide consulting or related services in any capacity, either directly or through another party. This includes services provided in preparation for the survey, assisting in the preparation of the self-assessment, conducting mock surveys, and helping with the interpretation of the standards. All requests for consulting services utilizing CBAHI employees or surveyors shall be directed to CBAHI. \u2022 Not declaring to CBAHI any business (including consulting) or recruiting relationship with one or more CBAHI surveyors either directly or through another party with whom he or she is affiliated at any time during the preceding three years.  Truthfulness and Ethics Clause  CBAHI strives to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of its business. This includes honesty, transparency, and truthfulness in all its dealings, and avoidance of all situations that might appear unethical or illegal. The same is expected from the HCFs/ACS services seeking CBAHI certification. CBAHI employees are committed to politely declining any gifts or gratuities offered to them or to members of their families, including spouses, children, and parents, when the donor expects something in return. Such gifts or gratuities may be attempts to gain an unfair advantage or influence the manner in which the employee or surveyor performs his/her job duties. Gifts of nominal value may be accepted as tokens of appreciation or goodwill provided they are given as gestures of a professional relationship and do not involve or create the appearance of any commitment in terms of survey results or certification decisions.   Business lunches, tea, coffee, and snacks during the survey are permitted. Other social gatherings are prohibited, and ACS services are encouraged to not offer such activities to the survey team.  CBAHI's confidential and proprietary business information is safeguarded and is utilized only in keeping with the best interests of CBAHI, its obligations to third parties, and the highest ethical and legal standards. Such information must not be disclosed to a third party without prior approval of a duly authorized member of CBAHI management for an acceptable reason. In line with CBAHI's core values, CBAHI maintains the confidentiality of all data and information about both CBAHI and HCFs/services. CBAHI is also committed to resolving complaints and ethical issues raised by CBAHI employees or client HCFs/services to ensure justice, confidentiality, impartiality, timeliness, and feedback to the complainants.

This includes non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The burden of ACS is on the rise globally and is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, ACS is a significant cause of mortality, and its burden is increasing due to the high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. ACS is a medical emergency that affects millions of people each year and requires immediate attention. It is a broad term that covers a range of potentially life-threatening cardiac conditions. It is almost always associated with the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque and partial or complete thrombosis of the infarct-related artery. The effectiveness of ACS service depends heavily on prompt diagnosis and treatment, as well as on effective leadership. The ACS program director is accountable for ensuring this provision of care. Administratively, leaders of ACS service need to clearly define the mission, scope of service, plans, programs, and policies to govern the service. In addition, leaders must work collaboratively, communicate effectively, allocate adequate resources to fulfil the mission, and integrate provided services, to ensure the quality and safety of ACS services.  This chapter focuses on the roles and responsibilities of the ACS service\u2019s leaders in the provision of reliable, timely, and safe services.

The quality staff support integrated data collection, aggregation, validation, analysis, and interpretation of relevant data from multiple sources including quality indicators. The ACS service implements at least one improvement project per year, based on prioritization, using an evidence-based approach such as FOCUS-PDCA or DMAIC models.  Performance indicators are measurable values expected to measure a specific aspect of performance. These indicators reflect the quality of care provided and are used as a guide to monitor, evaluate, and improve the quality of services. The collection of key performance indicator (KPI) measurements should follow an evidence-based approach and the selection criteria are based on essential priorities. The indicators should cover a variety of issues based on structure, process, and outcome.  Licensed by CBAHI to:ABEER ALJABER (aal-jaber@moh.gov.sa), Not for email, distribution or reproduction.", "36   These indicators may include adherence to the ACS pathway, Door-to-ECG, Door-to-device, the proportion of patients with high-risk NSTE-ACS that have a coronary angiography within 72 hours, ACS discharges with dual antiplatelet therapy, LVEF evaluation prior to discharge, secondary prevention plan, the proportion of patients diagnosed with ACS readmitted within 30 days after discharge, and crude/risk-adjusted mortality. The results of the indicators must be discussed with staff and reported regularly to hospital leadership along with action plans taken for improvement.

Licensed by CBAHI to:ABEER ALJABER (aal-jaber@moh.gov.sa), Not for email, distribution or reproduction.", "37   Explanation To ensure continuity of care, each patient cared for in the ACS service has an individual medical record that has a unique medical record number. The ACS service needs to develop a policy to ensure uniformity and legibility of writing in medical records and avoid misinterpretation of written information. Also, the policy should specify the category of staff allowed to write in the medical record. In the patient medical record, only standardized and approved abbreviations and symbols must be used because abbreviations can be problematic, confusing, interpreted differently, and may result in inadvertent medical errors. Standardized diagnoses, procedures, and services codes help programs track pathology and standard procedures and comply with the requirements of regulatory entities and insurance companies. Hence, a clinical documentation improvement (CDI) program is fundamental in any healthcare facility or service to ensure timely completion of the medical records, proper utilization of data, and accurate data reporting to the health authorities as per local regulations. If an electronic healthcare information system is used, an adequate data-capturing process during downtimes is critical to maintaining the completeness and comprehensiveness of data. At the end of a patient's visit, the medical record is returned to a safe medical records store or electronically stored.      LD.12.

The summary highlights the reason for the patient\u2019s initial admission, admission diagnosis, and the reason for transfer. The summary contains the in-hospital course, investigations, services provided, the patient\u2019s medication list and the time of the last dose(s) given, and infection prevention and control measures. The referral pathway determines staff accountability on both ends of the transfer process. The condition and status of the patient determine the qualifications of the staff member monitoring the patient and the type of medical technology needed during transfer. A consistent process for how patients are transferred from one facility to another is required to ensure that patients are transferred safely. The hospital evaluates the quality and safety of the transfer process to ensure that patients were transferred with qualified staff and the correct medical technology for the patient\u2019s condition. The patient must be monitored during the transfer process and the monitoring record must be kept in the patient\u2019s medical record. The receiving organization must check the patient\u2019s condition upon arrival.      PC.15. The ACS service discharges patients through an efficient, safe, and timely process. PC.15.1. The most responsible physician (MRP) specifies the estimated date of discharge for each patient upon admission and updates that throughout the duration of the stay.  PC.15.2. The most responsible physician (MRP) decides the identifiable clinical criteria for discharge and ensures the patient\u2019s suitability for discharge.  PC.15.3. All ACS patients receive a pre-discharge evaluation of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). PC.15.4. All medications and support services necessary for a safe discharge should be organized and documented in the discharge summary. PC.15.5. The discharge summary and follow-up plan are discussed with and provided to the patient prior to discharge. PC.15.6. Post-discharge care is coordinated based on the assessment of the patient and identified needs. PC.15.7. The patient, and family are educated about how to access care when needed.  Explanation  Patients and families should have the opportunity to identify and discuss their post-discharge needs (e.g., physical, emotional, social, and community support needs) with members of the multidisciplinary team making decisions for discharge. A documented post-discharge care plan is developed upon admission in partnership with the patient and family and a copy is provided to them. This may include relevant community services, self-management strategies (e.g., medication information and compliance advice, goals, and therapy to continue at home), ACS support services, any further rehabilitation or outpatient appointments, and an appropriate contact number for any queries. The patient and family are informed about how to obtain help. An emergency contact number that is available outside normal working hours is provided to the patient. The patient and family receive information on how and when to re-access health and supportive services when required.
